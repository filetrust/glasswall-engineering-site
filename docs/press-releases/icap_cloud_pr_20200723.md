## Glasswall Cloud-based ICAP Server Launched

**London, August 2020** Glasswall adds its ICAP Server to the range of cloud based products, giving customers the opportunity to secure their internet traffic with the award winning Glasswall technlogy.

**Integrates with existing network infrastucture**
The Internet Content Adaptation Protocol (ICAP) is used to modify the traffic passing through company networks to the internet. The Glasswall ICAP Server uses this facility to apply Glasswall's award winning technology to remove any potentially malicious content from both incoming and outgoing traffic. Many of the applications that are used to build company networks already include ICAP clients, this enables the Glasswall ICAP Server to be easily added to existing network solutions.

**Automatic Scaling**
Built using native cloud technlogy the Glasswall ICAP Server can scale automatically to accomodate fluctations in demand, meaning that end-users always receive their documents quickly, but costs are minimised when demand is low. Whether the user base is 8 or 800 thousand, the product will scale to accomodate the variations in traffic.

**Analysis of Threats**
The Glasswall ICAP Server rebuilds all common Office, image and archive file formats up to 500Mb in size providing end-users with safe documents, and Administrators with a comprehensive audit of the processed files and the cleaning actions carried out on them. The analysis carried out by the Glasswall ICAP Server provides a overall picture of the content that is posing a threat to the company. This intelligence can be used to support the work of the company's Information Security Team.

**Supports Supplemental Verification**
The Glasswall ICAP Server supports the use of addition third-party checks on documents that would otherwise be stopped. A Dynamic Execution Environment (also known as a sandbox or detonation chamber) can be optionally used to put an additional set of tests on a file providing more information on the received documents. 

*Dinis Cruz, Glasswall CTO and CISO said* "This is a great addition to the Glasswall product portfolio. The Glasswall ICAP Server means that end-users can access internet sourced documents with confidence."

*Danny Lopez, Glasswall CEO also added* "The Glasswall ICAP Server compliments our existing email solutions to provide companies with the abilty to trust every file"
